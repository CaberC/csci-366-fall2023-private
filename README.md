This coding project uses C to develop skills in the C coding language and in low level understanding of generalized CPU architecture.
For this project I created a model LMS CPU in C.
In the end it could read a simplified assembly into a small portion of allocated memory.
Load the cell and either move, output, preform math operations, or logic operations all based on the assembly commands.
